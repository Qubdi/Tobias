# For the very first run (initial setup):
docker compose build --no-cache    # Build images defined in docker-compose.yml from scratch without using cache.
docker compose up -d               # Start containers in detached mode (background).

# For subsequent runs (clean restart each time):
docker compose down -v  # Stop and remove containers, delete associated volumes (-v)
docker compose up -d                      # Start fresh containers again, including executing initialization scripts like init.sql.
